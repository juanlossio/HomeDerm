_**The first digital dermatology solution designed for older adults**_

## Introduction

HomeDerm is an easy-to-use, engaging, digital interface tailored to unique needs of older adults that allows them to share data, including skin images and an analytics platform that synthesizes information for care teams and enables real-time monitoring and accurate, timely decisions. 

HomeDerm bridges the digital divide in geriatric tele-dermatology for older adults, facilitating safe and convenient clinical management of dermatological conditions from the comfort of their home or care facility.	

HomeDerm helps reduce unnecessary visits and procedures, while ensuring prompt, high-quality care for patients who need it.

## Need statement

There is a need to create a senior-friendly form of communication between adults > 65 years old and dermatologists to provide timely and effective diagnosis and treatment of skin disease, while reducing unnecessary in-person visits.
